Description: Compute differential causal effects (dce) on (biological) networks.
    Given observational samples from a control experiment and non-control (e.g., cancer) for two genes A and B, we can compute differential causal effects with a (generalized) linear regression.
    If the causal effect of gene A on gene B in the control samples is different from the causal effect in the non-control samples the dce will differ from zero.
    We regularize the dce computation by the inclusion of prior network information from pathway databases such as KEGG.
